# Udemy-clone
Hello, everyone!

I'm excited to share my latest project â€“ a Cloud Service Website UI inspired by Udemyâ€™s design, built entirely with HTML and CSS. This project reflects my focus on clean layouts, responsive design, and user-friendly interfaces. It's a simple yet polished web page that could represent a real-world cloud service provider.

This is part of my ongoing journey to improve my front-end development skills.
